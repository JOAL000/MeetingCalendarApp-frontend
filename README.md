# Meeting Calendar App Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Meeting Calendar App**, a React-based application built with Vite. It allows users to manage meetings, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting them. The app uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and `axios` for API communication.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: A central hub to navigate between different sections of the app.
- **Meeting List**: View all meetings in a tabular format.
- **Meeting Form**: Add new meetings with details like title, date, time, level, participants, and description.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
